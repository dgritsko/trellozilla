Trello-Bugzilla Bookmarklet Builder

This utility can be used to generate a bookmarklet to convert a Bugzilla bug 
into a Trello card on the list and board you choose. Simply open "index.html"
in the browser of your choice, and you will be guided through the process of 
creating the bookmarklet. 

"bookmarklet-script-uncompressed.js" should be run through a Javascript minifier,
and the results should be stored in the "script" var in util.js if the 
bookmarklet itself needs to be modified.
